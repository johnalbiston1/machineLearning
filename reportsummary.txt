Practical Machine Learning
Assignment

1. data preparation
The first step was to look at the  training and test sets. It was noticed that not all the columns
rows were in the test set. Therefore the two files were reduced to the fields in the test set.

The time fields were removed and the fields were check to have the same lengths.

2. data set
The data sets contained 54 columns, including the persons name.

3. initial experimentation
As there were so many columns i looked to reduce the number using the PCA ( thrsh of 75%),
Principle component analysis
I then created a plot of the first two principle components. and they seemed to form clusters.
This was encouraging especially as there were 5 clusters. However these clusters were not due to the 
five possible A to E clasifications.
It appeared that these were the more down to the different peoples methods.
The training data set was divided between a training and test (validation set)with a split at 75%
A knn method was used on the PCA components and the test and training sets compared via a Confusion matrix

         E    9   10   12   11  840
While the results were responsibly good- Accuracy : 0.9346 , it did produce some errors
		 
4. Prediction for each person
It was then decided to try and build a model for each person

Count of no	Column Labels						
Row Labels	A		B		C		D		E		Grand Total
adelmo		1165	776		750		515		686		3892
carlitos	834		690		493		486		609		3112
charles		899		745		539		642		711		3536
eurico		865		592		489		582		542		3070
jeremy		1177	489		652		522		562		3402
pedro		640		505		499		469		497		2610
						
Grand Total	5580	3797	3422	3216	3607	19622
There was enough data to build these individual predictions

example -carlitos
          Reference
Prediction   A   B   C   D   E
         A 200   0   1   4   0
         B   4 150   8   5   1
         C   0   2 119   0   0
         D   0   2   3 114   0
         E   0   2   1   1 145
		 
		 Accuracy : 0.9554 
		 
this increased the accuracy.

5. testing the true test data set
The model made was then used to predict for the 20 cases in the testing set.
However the model for the person was used to answer the question only for that person.

6. Outcome
the model was very successful for most of the people. the only issue was for Jeremy.
This was due to some variables not have any variation in them for that person.
 this created an issue, so a model was made excluding the variable that has no variation
 
7. Summary
 A very simple approach was undertaken.
Models were built in only a few seconds, and created a good accuracy.
Random forest seemed to be an alternative but takes hours to run.
